# Epuesta

Epuesta is a decentralized betting broker framework built with ChainLink.

Everyone can create a new contract with our framework on Ethereum as a broker for a specific match, you can customize your need and offer different deals with the contract. The finality of a match is submitted by Chainlink nodes in an decentralized manner, and betting result is distributed fairly with the contract.
